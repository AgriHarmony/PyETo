Overview

Three methods for estimating ETo/PET are implemented:

1. FAO Penman-Monteith (Allen et al, 1998)
2. Hargreaves (Hargreaves and Samani, 1982; 1985)
3. Thornthwaite (Thornthwaite, 1948)

These methods are outlined below.

-------------------
FAO Penman-Monteith
-------------------
This is the method recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of
the United Nations (FAO) for estimating ETo for a grass crop using limited
meteorological data (see Allen et al, 1998).

The FAO Penman-Monteith equation requires site location, air temperature,
humidity, radiation and wind speed data for daily, weekly, ten-day or
monthly ETo calculations.

Before using this method you should familiarise yourself with chapters 1 to 4
of Allen et al (1998), which provide detailed guidelines for estimating ETo,
including how to choose appropriate equations for estimating missing
meteorological data.

----------
Hargreaves
----------
The Hargreaves method is recommended by the FAO as an alternative
method for estimating ETo if insufficient meteorological data are available
for the Penman-Monteith method. However, the FAO suggest that using the
FAO Penman-Monteith method with estimated solar radiation, vapor pressure
and wind speed generally provides more accurate estimates than the Hargreaves
equation. This is due to the ability of the estimation equations to
incorporate general climatic characteristics such as high or low wind speed
or high or low relative humidity into the ETo estimate made using the
FAO Penman-Monteith method.

The Hargreaves equation has a tendency to under-estimate ETo under high wind
conditions(u2 > 3m/s) and to over-estimate under conditions of high relative
humidity.

------------
Thornthwaite
------------
This method estimates monthly PET using only minimum, maximum and mean monthly
temperature, and latitude. It has similar deficiencies to the Hargreaves
method.
